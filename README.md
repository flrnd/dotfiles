# dotfiles

First source of procrastination.

### things you will find here

* Some uninteresting wallpapers
* Custom Zsh config with homemade prompt, with few stuff borrowed from prezto
* ~~Same for bash~~. Minimal Bash configuration, but not as complete as the zsh one.
* Neovim setup ~~sadly, old and forgotten since Vscode came to life~~. Minimal lua config.
* Some other old stuff that I don't know why I still keep it, digital diogenes syndrome maybe?
