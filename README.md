# dotfiles

First source of procrastination.

### things you will find here

* Some uninteresting wallpapers
* Custom Zsh config with homemade prompt, with few stuff borrowed from prezto
* Same for bash
* Neovim setup, sadly, old and forgotten since Vscode came to life.
* Some other old stuff that I don't know why I still keep it, digital diogenes syndrome maybe?
